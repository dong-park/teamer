# Product Requirements Document: Ambient Light Start Button

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing an ambient light effect on the start button, creating a pulsing, glowing animation similar to ambient lighting.

## Objective
Create an engaging and visually appealing start button with an ambient light effect that pulses and glows to attract user attention and enhance the user experience.

## Requirements

### Visual Design
1. **Glow Effect**
   - Soft, diffused light emanating from the button
   - Multiple layers of glow for depth
   - Smooth gradient transitions from button center to edges

2. **Animation**
   - Pulsing/breathing animation effect
   - Continuous loop animation
   - Smooth easing curves for natural movement
   - Adjustable animation speed

3. **Color Scheme**
   - Primary glow color matching brand colors
   - Optional multi-color transitions
   - Adjustable opacity and intensity
   - Dark mode compatibility

### Technical Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Smooth 60fps animation
   - Minimal CPU/GPU usage
   - Hardware acceleration where possible
   - Mobile device optimization

2. **Compatibility**
   - Cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Mobile responsive
   - Fallback for older browsers
   - Accessibility considerations

3. **Implementation Options**
   - CSS animations with box-shadow
   - CSS filters and blur effects
   - SVG filters for advanced effects
   - Canvas/WebGL for complex animations (if needed)

### User Interaction
1. **Hover State**
   - Intensified glow on hover
   - Faster pulse rate
   - Color shift option

2. **Active State**
   - Brief flash effect on click
   - Ripple effect from click point
   - Smooth transition to pressed state

3. **Disabled State**
   - Reduced or no glow effect
   - Dimmed appearance
   - Clear visual indication of disabled state

### Customization Options
1. **Configurable Parameters**
   - Glow intensity (0-100%)
   - Animation speed (slow/medium/fast)
   - Glow radius/spread
   - Color values (primary/secondary)
   - Enable/disable animation

2. **Presets**
   - Subtle glow (professional)
   - Medium glow (balanced)
   - Intense glow (gaming/entertainment)
   - Custom preset support

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Button displays smooth ambient light animation
2. Animation performs at 60fps on modern devices
3. Effect is visible but not distracting
4. Accessible to users with visual impairments
5. Works across all supported browsers
6. Customizable through configuration
7. Maintains performance on mobile devices

## Example Implementation Approaches

### CSS-based Approach
- Multiple box-shadows with animation
- CSS custom properties for customization
- Keyframe animations for pulsing
- Filter effects for glow intensity

### Advanced Approach
- SVG filters for complex glow effects
- Blend modes for realistic lighting
- GPU-accelerated transforms
- Dynamic color calculations

## Success Metrics
- User engagement increase with the button
- Performance benchmarks met (60fps)
- Positive user feedback on visual appeal
- No accessibility complaints
- Cross-platform consistency
