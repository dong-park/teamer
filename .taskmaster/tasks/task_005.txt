# Title: Add Interactive Touch States for React Native
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement enhanced glow effects for user interactions including onPress, onPressIn, onPressOut states
# Details:
Create intensified glow on onPressIn with faster pulse rate using react-native-reanimated. Implement onPressOut state with brief flash effect and ripple animation from touch point. Add proper TouchableOpacity feedback and haptic feedback using react-native-haptic-feedback. Use react-native-reanimated for smooth state transitions. Implement color shift options for press states.

# Test Strategy:
Test all interactive states work correctly on both platforms. Verify smooth transitions between states. Test haptic feedback on supported devices. Validate touch interactions feel responsive and natural on mobile devices.
