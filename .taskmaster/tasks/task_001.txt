# Priority: high
# Description: Verify React Native project structure and development environment for the ambient light start button component
# Details:
Verify existing React Native project setup with App.tsx and components/StartButton.tsx. Confirm NativeWind (Tailwind CSS) configuration is working properly. Validate that required animation libraries are installed and functional: react-native-reanimated, react-native-skia, react-native-linear-gradient, and lottie-react-native. Test development environment with Metro bundler and ensure project runs on iOS/Android simulators. Verify TypeScript configuration and global.css setup.

# Test Strategy:
Run 'npm start' to verify Metro bundler starts successfully. Test 'npm run ios' and 'npm run android' to ensure app launches properly. Verify existing StartButton component renders without errors. Check that NativeWind classes apply correctly. Validate no missing dependencies or configuration issues.
