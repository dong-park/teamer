# Title: Performance Optimization and React Native Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize for 60fps animation performance and conduct comprehensive testing across iOS and Android devices
# Details:
Optimize React Native animations using react-native-reanimated runOnUI, useNativeDriver equivalent features. Minimize JavaScript bridge calls during animations. Test performance on low-end Android devices and older iOS devices. Implement performance monitoring using React Native performance tools. Create comprehensive test suite using Jest for component logic and manual testing for visual effects.

# Test Strategy:
Monitor and verify 60fps performance across iOS and Android devices. Test CPU/GPU usage using Xcode Instruments and Android profiler. Conduct user acceptance testing on physical devices. Verify all acceptance criteria are met. Test edge cases and performance under various device conditions.
