# Title: Implement Disabled State and React Native Accessibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Add disabled button state with reduced glow and comprehensive React Native accessibility support
# Details:
Implement disabled prop with dimmed appearance and reduced/no glow effect. Add React Native accessibility properties: accessibilityLabel, accessibilityRole, accessibilityState. Ensure proper screen reader support for iOS VoiceOver and Android TalkBack. Implement reduced motion support using react-native-reanimated reduceMotion. Add high contrast mode support using React Native AccessibilityInfo.

# Test Strategy:
Test disabled state visual appearance and functionality on both platforms. Verify VoiceOver and TalkBack compatibility. Test accessibility navigation thoroughly. Validate reduced motion preferences are respected on iOS and Android.
